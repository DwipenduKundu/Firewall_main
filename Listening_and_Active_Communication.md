## Types of Communication
### Question 5
### When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?

I switch to passive communication when I’m unsure about a topic or want to avoid conflict. For example, in group discussions, I may hold back my opinions even when I disagree.  

### Question 6
### When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?
I become aggressive when I feel I’m not being heard or when something feels unfair. I may raise my voice or dominate the conversation. Sometime when someone not agreed with the correct point he/she not intrested to understand or listen atleast. 

### Question 7
### When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?

I become passive-aggressive when I feel hurt but don’t want to confront the person directly. I might give the silent treatment or make sarcastic comments instead of being honest.  

### Question 8

- **Speak clearly and respectfully**: Say what I feel or need without being rude.  
- **Use “I” statements**: Like “I feel like that” or “I need to do that” instead of blaming others.  
- **Practice saying no**: politely when I can’t do something, instead of saying yes and regretting it.  
- **Manage my tone and body language**: Stay calm and confident, not aggressive.  
- **Set boundaries**: Clearly explain what is okay and what is not, especially in work or team management.
