## Learning Principles in the Bootcamp

### Doing things with 100% involvement

* Programming is essentially a result of your sustained and concentrated attention.
* Preserving attention is a skill that you can get better with time.
* Read up on deep work - [https://doist.com/blog/deep-work/](https://doist.com/blog/deep-work/)
* Work when you work, play when you play is a good thumb rule.
* Always keep your phone on silent. Remove notifications from the home screen. Only keep notifications for work-related apps.
* You should strongly consider blocking social media sites and apps during work hours. Tools like TimeLimit, Freedom, or any other app can be helpful.
* We recommend tracking your time using app like [Boosted](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.boostedproductivity.app&hl=en_IN) to improve productivity.

### How to learn Software Concepts

1. Where is this concept used or applied?
2. What is the concept? Can I explain it to someone in my own words?
3. How can I implement it in code or designt?
4. By when do I need to complete the practice drills or assignment or project for this topic?

Few points to keep in mind:
- The deadlines are only a tool for you to allocate certain time for the topics.
- Focus on the concept. Approach it with curiosity and joy.
- Make the process of learning fun and easy for you.
- Make the concept your own. Your own words, your own way of understanding it, your own code.
- You know a concept well when you can teach it. If someone wakes you up at 3 am in the night for some software issue, you can easily fix it and go to sleep.
- You may not have skill in everything in the world. If you master a few skills very well, you will be successful.

### How are you evaluated as a trainee?

1. Does this person understand concepts well? Can explain verbally and/or in writing.
2. Does this person implement the concepts in code clearly?
3. Does this person work intensely and completes work in time alloted?
4. Does this person communicate proactively about obstacles and difficulties?
5. Does this person communicate clearly in precise words?


### Question 5

What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?


### Answer:
- Use the Feynman Technique to explain concepts in our own words.
- Switch between focused and diffused thinking modes by taking breaks.
- Break skills into smaller parts and practice regularly.
- Limit distractions like silence phone, block social media, remove non-essential notifications.
- Track our time using productivity apps.
- Work with 100% focus during study or work.
- Set realistic deadlines and treat them as time blocks.
