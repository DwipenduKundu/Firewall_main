# Sexual Harassment Awareness and Response

## 1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

- Staring in a sexually suggestive way.
- Sending sexually explicit texts, emails, or images.
- Displaying pornographic or offensive material.

### Physical Behaviours:
- Unwanted touching, hugging, patting, or brushing up against someone.
- Attempting to kiss or make physical advances.
- Blocking someone’s path or invading their personal space.

### Power-related Behaviours:

## 2. What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

### If You Are Directly Affected:
- **Stay calm and assertive** – If safe, tell the person their behavior is unwelcome and must stop.
- **Document the incident(s)** – Note the time, location, description, and any witnesses.
- **Report the behaviour** – Use your organization’s reporting channels, such as:
  - Immediate supervisor or manager
  - HR department
  - Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) or designated officer (if applicable)
- **Seek support** – Talk to a trusted colleague, mentor, or a professional counselor.

### If You Are a Witness:
- **Support the affected individual** – Let them know you believe them and are available to help.
- **Document your observations** – Include dates, locations, and what you witnessed.
- **Report the incident** – Notify HR or a relevant authority, even if the affected person hesitates to report it themselves.

## Final Note:
Every workplace should have a clear **Sexual Harassment Policy** in line with relevant laws (e.g., the POSH Act in India). Being aware of your rights and responsibilities is essential for fostering a safe and respectful work environment.
