### Question 1
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
###  Answer
One of the most interesting ideas from the video is the concept of:
Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you want to become.
This idea shifts the focus from goals to identity.
Instead of just saying `I want to run a marathon,` you start acting like `I am a runner.`

Each small habit like putting on your shoes or running for five minutes is a vote for that identity.

* It’s powerful because it connects habits to who you are, not just what you do.
* It makes even tiny habits meaningful, because they shape your self-image over time.
* It’s not about doing something perfectly once — it’s about doing it consistently enough that you believe in your new identity.

### Question 2
How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
### Answer
B = MAP is a behavior model created by BJ Fogg that explains how behavior happens.
* B=Behavior
* M=Motivation
* A=Ability
* P=Prompt

So, according to this model:

A ***behavior*** happens when ***Motivation***, ***Ability***, and ***Prompt*** come together at the same time.

To make new habits easier, focus on:
* Reducing the need for high motivation.
* Making the habit tiny and easy to do, so that it fits your current level of ability.
* Finding a good prompt/trigger — something that already happens in your day (like brushing your teeth or finishing a meeting) to remind you to do the habit.

Example:
Instead of `I will do 30 pushups every day` , you say:
`After I brush my teeth, I will do 2 pushups`.

### Question 3
Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

### Answer
Celebration is a key part of building habits in BJ Fogg’s method.

When you celebrate immediately after doing a new habit, it creates a positive emotion in your brain. This positive emotion helps your brain associate the habit with feeling good, and that helps the habit to stick.
* The brain wires in habits not just by repetition, but by emotion.
* What you celebrate, you accelerate.
* If your brain feels success, it wants to do the habit again.


### Question 4
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

### Answer
From this video James clear told us about his book Atomic Habits. He told us a story of 1%improvements in unexpected areas to get a massive success. 
#### The story of British Cycling:
Fifteen years ago, British Cycling was nothing special. Since 1908, they had won a single Olympic gold medal. They had never won a Tour de France—the most prestigious race in cycling.

They were so underwhelming that one top European bike manufacturer refused to sell them bikes, worried that seeing British cyclists on their equipment would hurt sales.

Then they hired Dave Brailsford. He brought with him a philosophy he called `The Aggregation of Marginal Gains.`

Brailsford believed in improving every aspect of cycling by just 1%, and aggregating those tiny gains into something powerful.

hey didn’t limit themselves to just training or strategy—they optimized sleep, nutrition, the design of their bikes, even the handwashing techniques to reduce illness. These small changes seemed insignificant on their own, but over time, they compounded to create massive improvements.

Eventually, these 1% gains led the British cycling team to win multiple Tour de France titles and dominate the Olympics.
At the 2012 London Olympics, British cyclists won 70% of the gold medals available in track cycling.

#### Lesson:
These weren’t big changes. These were tiny improvements—and they led to massive success.

### Question 5
What is the book's perspective about Identity?

### Answer
The true behavior change is identity change.
`The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.`
`The goal is not to run a marathon, it’s to become a runner.`
* Your habits are a reflection of your identity.
* Lasting change comes from the inside out—when you focus on who you want to become, not just what you want to achieve.
* Every time you do a habit, you’re casting a vote for the type of person you want to be.


### Question 6
Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

### Answer
The book says: Make it easy.
Ways to make a habit easier:
* Start small:
Make your habit so small that it takes two minutes or less — like `Put on running shoes` or `Open the book.`
* Reduce friction:
Remove obstacles that make it harder to start the habit. For example, lay out your gym clothes the night before.
* Use environment design:
Make good habits the default by shaping your surroundings. If you want to eat healthy, put fruit on the counter and hide junk food.


### Question 7
Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
### Answer
This is about breaking bad habits, and the principle is the opposite:
`Make it hard.` or `Make it Difficult.`
#### Ways to make a bad habit harder:

* Increase friction:
Make the behavior less convenient. For example, delete social media apps or log out each time so it's not instantly accessible.

* Use a commitment device:
Set up a system that locks you into good behavior. For example, give someone money that they get to keep if you break your habit.

* Change your environment:
If junk food is out of the house, you're less likely to eat it. If your phone is in another room, you’ll be less likely to scroll.

## 5. Reflection:

### Question 8:
Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

### Answer

I want to do coding daily.
I try to apply the Atomic Habits:

##### Make the Cue Obvious
* Set a fixed time:
“After I finish dinner, I will code for 30 minutes.”

* Keep your laptop open with your code editor ready or pin the coding tab in your browser.

* Add a calendar reminder or sticky note on your desk that says: `CODE NOW.`

#####  Make it Attractive
* Work on projects that interest you like do coding on intrested project domain or topics.

* Join a coding community to make streaks of 100days.
* Listen to your favorite music while coding to boost the mood.

##### Make it Easy
* Start with just 5–10 minutes. Make the rule I only need to write one line of code.
* Use templates or starter projects so you’re not starting from scratch.

* Have your IDE, files, and browser tabs already open to reduce friction.

##### Make it Satisfying
* Track your coding streak.
* Share progress on social media or with a friend for a small dopamine hit.
* Say to yourself Nice I’m becoming a real developer and Celebrate it with a fist pump or smile it really helps reinforce the habit.

### Question 9:
Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

### Answer

The habit is `Scrolling Instagram mindlessly.`
I want to disappear that by using of the Atomic Habits approach:


##### Make the Cue Invisible:
* Delete the app from your phone or move it to a hidden folder.
* Keep your phone in another room during focused time.


##### Make it Unattractive
* Remind yourself of the negative effects (wasted time, less sleep, more stress).

* Replace it with a more meaningful alternative (like calling a friend).

##### Make it Difficult
* Use an app blocker or timmer.

* Log out every time so you have to manually enter the password.


##### Make it Unsatisfying

* Set up a consequence: e.g., if you scroll for more than 10 minutes, you donate money then you don't like scrolling.
